Chuck Grassley, who as Judiciary chairman is a key figure in the battle over Merrick Garland's nomination, shot back at Roberts, essentially advising the chief justice to look in the mirror.\n\n\"In fact, many of my constituents believe, with all due respect, that the chief justice is part of the problem,\" Grassley said of Roberts, who has at times incensed conservatives with his votes to uphold Obamacare and other rulings. \"They believe that [a] number of his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones.\"","tweets":{"3":".@ChuckGrassley I contributed to your re-election campaign because you called out Chief Justice Roberts. https://www.tally.us","16":".@judge_patty I contributed to your campaign because @ChuckGrassley called out Chief Justice Roberts. https://www.tally.us","14":".@dscc I contributed to the DSCC because @ChuckGrassley called out Chief Justice Roberts. https://www.tally.us"},"supportPacs":["3"],"opposePacs":["16","14"],"created":1459969153.155,"modified":1459969159.062,"iden":"107"}, "108": {"imageUrl":"https://tally.imgix.net/images/0iinfo0vy8axajorpn6ukfy2njfnipb9.jpg","imageAttribution":"[Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/ted-cruz-most-conservative-republican-nominee-221729#ixzz45GZA263y)","politician":"10","headline":"Ted Cruz would be the most conservative nominee in ages","summary":"[From Politico:](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/ted-cruz-most-conservative-republican-nominee-221729#ixzz45GZA263y)\n\nTed Cruz wants to resurrect the gold standard.
